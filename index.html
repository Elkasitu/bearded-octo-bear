<a name="welcome-to-the-travian-raider-project" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-travian-raider-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the Travian Raider Project!</h3>

<p>This is the main page for my current project: Travian Raider, which is a program for the Browser Game "Travian" that allows you to create, delete and modify a raidlist within a GUI and launch multiple raids with the click of a button! Of course this has already been implemented by the Travian Team, but it requires gold, 50 in 3x speed servers and 100 in normal speed servers.</p>

<p>Not only can you manage your raids, but you can also check how many troops you have in total, how many troops are there in your village, raiding, at other villages, etc.</p>

<p>Right now the features are quite limited (and the GUI is quite ugly) but this project started as a way to extend my Python knowledge, it's also my first time making a GUI for a program so it's a good way to expand my horizons, I do this in my spare time and I enjoy it very much, so I hope that you like it as well.</p>

<p>Feel free to change it however you like as long as you stick to the license (included in the repo's root)</p>
